# Python Coding Practice 🐍

Welcome to my Python coding practice repo!  
This is a personal space where I strengthen my fundamentals for coding interviews — one problem at a time.

## 🧠 Purpose

As a QA professional transitioning into SDET/Software development roles, I’m using this repo to:
- Build muscle memory with Python
- Practice clean logic and core problem-solving patterns
- Prepare for coding interviews

## 💡 What You’ll Find

- ✅ Basic Python logic and syntax exercises
- ✅ Interview-style problems (e.g. palindrome, FizzBuzz, duplicates, factorial, prime numbers)
- ✅ Data structure use-cases (lists, strings, arrays, recursion, loops)
- ✅ My solutions and experiments — continuously improving

## 🚀 Goals

- Grow into a confident engineer and problem solver
- Contribute to real-world Playwright and React projects at work
- Build a foundation strong enough to transition toward development roles

## 🤝 Open to Feedback

If you're viewing this repo and have suggestions on improving readability, structure, or Pythonic best practices — feel free to open an issue or share a comment.

Thanks for checking this out!
